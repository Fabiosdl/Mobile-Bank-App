# Mobile-Bank-App

Backend Development

Developed the backend of a mobile banking application using Spring Boot. The project features a fully functional REST API, tested via Postman, and utilizes JPA/Hibernate for interaction with a MySQL database. The application is containerized with Docker for easy deployment and scalability. OpenAPI and Swagger-UI were used for comprehensive API documentation. Currently implementing Flyway for version-controlled database migrations.
